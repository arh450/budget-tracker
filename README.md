## Brief Description

This is a basic budget-tracker PWA that uses a noSQL database and the Mongoose ORM to allow a user to log deposits and withdrawals with or without an internet connection. When using the application offline the user should see their previously logged transactions, and then when a user brings their connection back online they will be able to see what they logged while they were offline.
